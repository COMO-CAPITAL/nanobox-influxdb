# nanobox InfluxDB configuration
#

### Welcome to the InfluxDB configuration file.
# Once every 24 hours InfluxDB will report usage data to usage.influxdata.com
# The data includes a random ID, os, arch, version, the number of series and other
# usage data. No data from user databases is ever transmitted.
# Change this option to true to disable reporting.
reporting-disabled = <%= config[:reporting_disabled] %>
# we'll try to get the hostname automatically, but if it the os returns something
# that isn't resolvable by other servers in the cluster, use this option to
# manually set the hostname
# hostname = "localhost"

# Bind address to use for the RPC service for backup and restore.
bind-address = ":8088"

### [meta]
### Controls the parameters for the Raft consensus group that stores metadata
### about the InfluxDB cluster.

### [data]
### Controls where the actual shard data for InfluxDB lives and how it is
### flushed from the WAL. "dir" may need to be changed to a suitable place
### for your system, but the WAL settings are an advanced configuration. The
### defaults should work for most systems.

  # cardinality datasets.

  # discover slow or resource intensive queries.  Setting the value to 0 disables the slow query logging.
  log-queries-after = "0"

  # The maximum number of points a SELECT can process.  A value of 0 will make
  # the maximum point count unlimited.  This will only be checked every second so queries will not
  # be aborted immediately when hitting the limit.

  # The maximum number of series a SELECT can run.  A value of 0 will make the maximum series
  # count unlimited.

### [shard-precreation]
### Controls the precreation of shards, so they are available before data arrives.

### [monitor]
### Controls the system self-monitoring, statistics and diagnostics.
### The internal database for monitoring data is created automatically if
### if it does not already exist. The target retention within this database
### is called 'monitor' and is also created with a retention period of 7 days
### and a replication factor of 1, if it does not exist. In all cases the
### this retention policy is configured as the default for the database.
[monitor]

###
### [logging]
###
### Controls how the logger emits logs to the output.
###

[logging]
  # Determines which log encoder to use for logs. Available options
  # are auto, logfmt, and json. auto will use a more a more user-friendly
  # output format if the output terminal is a TTY, but the format is not as
  # easily machine-readable. When the output is a non-TTY, auto will use
  # logfmt.

  # are error, warn, info, and debug. Logs that are equal to or above the
  # specified level will be emitted.

### received by the InfluxDB host.

### [[graphite]]
### Controls one or many listeners for Graphite data.
[[graphite]]
  enabled = false
  ### This string joins multiple matching 'measurement' values providing more control over the final measurement name.
  ### Default tags that will be added to all metrics.  These can be overridden at the template level
  ### or by tags extracted from metric
  ### Each template line requires a template pattern.  It can have an optional
  ### filter before the template and separated by spaces.  It can also have optional extra
  ### tags following the template.  Multiple tags should be separated by commas and no spaces
  ### similar to the line protocol format.  There can be only one default template.

### [collectd]
### Controls one or many listeners for collectd data.
[[collectd]]
  enabled = false

### [opentsdb]
